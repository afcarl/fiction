metadata
========

chicagometa -- the randomly-selected stuff from oldchicagometa, plus human additions and edits

datadictionary -- explaining genre tags

genremeta -- metadata file (from various sources) up to the point where I ran scripts (metamunge, metafix) to amplify metadata and simplify the genre tag system. That created

intermediatemeta -- metadata with teamred and teamblack randomly assigned. Further processing with the tagcounter script added the "stew" tag and produced

finalmeta -- currently in use

oldchicagometa -- randomly selected using code/get_chicago_data.py

librarymeta -- metadata for a classifier based on #of-libraries-holding
