fiction
=======

Code and data for a project exploring the history of fictional genres. 

The strategy is not to rely on any single definition of genre, but to gather a bunch of _different_ sources of social testimony about overlapping genre categories. "Librarians have tagged these books as 'science fiction, but here's a more inclusive bibliography of "speculative fiction," so let's record that too -- and so on."

We'll then use predictive modeling to map relations of similarity and dissimilarity between these different definitions of genre, and, ultimately, to trace macroscopic histories of generic differentiation or convergence.
